Problem with fullcalendar 3.10.2 and webpack consuming

- npm install
- npm start

launch index.html from dist folder

### Uncaught TypeError: $(...).fullCalendar is not a function - in console
# Notes

- Changing back to 3.10.1 works fine.
- Deleting the sub node-modules folder from fullcalendar in node_modules and running npm start again works with 3.10.2
